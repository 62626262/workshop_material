Stage 1: 
Requirement: 
We need to print a staircase with height and base equal to the user input value. we need to use # symbol as building block for stair case. 

Condition: 
the last/bottom line should not have any spaces from the left
the height and the width of the staircase needs to be same. 

Input: 
User will give input n positive integer number of steps. 10, 5, 15

Output: 
Print a staircase of size n using # symbols

testcases: 
Given 4 as user input the output should print 4 stair cases with bottom line having 4 #'s. 


Stage 2:
Part 1: 
Take user input 
Part 2: 
Print the spaces 
Part 3:
Print the # symbols
Part 4: 
Set the end condition

Stage 3: 

Part 1: 
Take user input 
  take n = input from user 
Part 2: 
Print the spaces 
  for x = 1 to n 
	for 1 to n-x n-x > 0
		print space
Part 3:
Print the # symbols
  for x = 1 to n 
	for n-x to n
		print #
Part 4: 
Set the end condition
no of rows == n: stop the program. 

Integration code: 
we can merge both 2 and 3 parts together into one loop
for x = 1 to n 
	for y=1 to n-x n-x > y
		print space
	for z=n-x to n
		print #
Stage 4:  

var n = prompt("Input no of Stairs");
for(var i=1;i<=n;i++) {
	for(var j=1;j<=n-i;j++) {
		document.write(" ");
	}
	for(var k=1;k<=i;k++) {
		document.write("#");
	}
	document.write("<br/>");
}


Stage 5: 
Try to Run above javascript online or using a html page and
see if it will run directly as written.
